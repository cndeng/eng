!!Ambulance Girl

:<pre>

When I became a volunteer EMT, my friends were [[puzzle]]d. 
They knew me to be deeply terrified of sick and dying people. 
If there was an accident on the road, I [[tuck]]ed my head in my hands to avoid seeing blood or broken glass. 
My husband and I had been married 30 years. 
We loved to travel, read and write.

 But at age 52, I felt [[stuck]] in a [[midlife]] [[funk]], cut off from others. 
Passing the local firehouse one day, I saw a sign:  “Volunteers wanted:  Fire/EMT.” 
The EMT part pointed to everything [[cowardly]] in me—my [[fear]] of death and disease.
 
Maybe I could help others if I did this and could also save myself by facing what scared me most. 
As time goes by, I was able to work through my fears. 

Now I understand that the closest I have ever felt to God is in the back of an [[ambulance]]. 
When I rush out to help sick strangers, I am part of something larger than myself. 

Sometimes I truly connect with someone who I would never have met otherwise—as I did with Nellie. 
One midnight, the AIDS hospice needed help. 

A [[colleague]] and I were shown to a bedroom. 
Lying there was a thin black woman with [[wild]] hair.
 
When I was given a [[printout]] of her medical history, I thought, this lady should be dead over ten times. 
She had AIDS, [[hepatitis]] and TB. 
She had had brain [[surgery]]. 
Tonight she had a [[seizure]]. 
“Hello, I’m [[Clarissa]], are you in pain?” I asked. 
She replied by cursing at me. I didn’t take [[offense]].
 
When I rode alone with her in the back of the ambulance as another EMT drove, I [[reread]] the printout. 
Nellie was 33 years old. No previous address.

No family members. No next of [[kin]].
Her whole life as presented here was just a list of medicines, [[symptom]]s and illnesses. 

One line caught my attention:  Hobbies. 
Nellie’s [[hobbies]] were [[sewing]] and gospel singing. 
I could not [[sew]], but I loved [[gospel]] music. 
“Nellie, it says here that you like [[gospel]] music, ” I asked. 
I expected another [[curse]], but it didn’t come. 

“I really like Shirley Caesar, ” I continued, thinking of the singer’s [[heartbreaking]] song about a mother’s love for her [[ungrateful]] son, pouring her soul into every word. 
Suddenly Nellie’s eyes moved back and [[forth]]. 

“I like her too, ” Nellie said weakly. I was [[stun]]ned she could speak. 
I started naming other gospel singers. 
With each one, Nellie nodded back, and I saw her try to smile. 
I was not a singer, but I decided to [[pretend]] that I was. 
It was not [[unthinkable]] that Nellie might die during this ride to the hospital, that I would be the last face she ever saw, the last voice she ever heard. 
I wanted to say something meaningful to her, something other than “Where does it hurt?” 
So I started singing, and I held Nellie’s hand as I sang. 
We reached the hospital, and she was [[wheel]]ed to one of the ER rooms. 
I touched her thin [[shoulder]]. “Nellie, ” I said. 
She fixed her eyes on me. 
“Take care of yourself.” 
She gave me one long last look, and then turned her face to the wall.
 
When I climbed back into the ambulance, there was no more [[trace]] of [[Nellie]]. 

The driver had cleaned and [[sanitize]]d everything.  “Let’s go, ” I told him. 

As the [[ambulance]] pulled out, I felt like crying.
 
But my eyes remained dry, like [[Nellie]]’s Hobbies:  [[sewing]] and [[gospel]] music, I thought as we [[glide]]d in the darkness of the night toward home.
