Monologue
The following monologue is  about some threats to the forests in America.
The Forest Service is [[responsible]] for the forests on public land in the US. 
It [[supervise]]s almost 78 million [[hectare]]s of forests, grasslands, rivers and lakes.
hectare : 公顷, 
It’s an [[agency]] of the Department of [[Agriculture|agriculture]]. 
Agriculture:农业
Forest Service officials say there are 4 major [[threat]]s to forests and wild land in America. 
threat: 威胁 
The first is the threat of fire and fuel. 
Fires are a natural enemy of forest growth, but they can also [[threaten]] lives and property. 
Fuel is dead plant material and small plants that grow under tall trees. 
The Forest Service [[estimate]]s that up to one fourth of the forests it supervises have dangerous levels of fuel. 

> estimate : 评估

Sometimes foresters set controlled fires to remove the fuel. 
Other times the fuel must be cleared by hand. 
Another threat to forests is from [[invasive]] [[species]]. 
invasive: 蔓延的
species: 物种
These are non native plants and animals that push out native kinds. 
push out :冲击
They can cause a lot of [[economic]] damage. Some [[invader]]s are [[insect]]s, some are [[disease]]s, 
economic: 经济的
invader: 入侵者
insect:昆虫
and others are plants like the fastgrowing [[kudzu]] [[vine]]. 
kudzu: 野葛
vine:藤本植物
The agency says another threat to the health of wild land is the loss of open space.
 It says over 1 hectare of forest or grassland is lost to development every minute. 
Development also leads to the division of large natural areas into smaller ones. 
The fourth threat to public land is what the Forest Service calls [[unmanaged]] [[recreation]]. 
unmanaged: 未被管控的
recreation: 娱乐
People can hunt, fish and camp in many national forests. 
But careless use of [[motor]] [[vehicle]]s and other actions can be [[destructive]]. 
motor:马达
destructive: 破坏性的, 毁灭性的
