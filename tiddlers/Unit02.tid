Recently, there [[are]] two [[tragedies]] which happened to children in China. Two kids died of over-drinking, because their [[adult]] [[relatives]] [[coaxed]] them into drinking. This kind of behavior of teasing baby has gained social attention and even [[criticism]].

```bash
# 最近，中国发生了两起儿童悲剧。两个孩子死于酗酒，因为他们的成年亲戚哄骗他们喝酒。这种戏弄婴儿的行为已经引起了社会的关注甚至批评。
```
Chinese are used to making fun of babies to [[express]] their love. They often make the kids try something, like wines or [[unlit]] [[cigarette]], to see how they [[react]]. However, they don’t [[aware]] that it is harmful.


```bash
# 中国人习惯于用取笑婴儿来表达他们的爱。他们经常让孩子们尝试一些东西，比如葡萄酒或未点燃的香烟，看看他们的反应。然而，他们没有意识到它是有害的。
```
[[Psychologists|psychologists]] put that making fun of children may cause [[potential]] physical and [[mental]] harm to the children. Children may develop [[sense]] of [[insecurity]] and [[misunderstanding]].


```bash
#心理学家认为，取笑孩子可能会对孩子的身心造成潜在的伤害。孩子可能会产生不安全感和误解。
```
When I was a little kid, I was often told that I was picked up from a [[dumpster]]. Although I knew it was a joke made by my parents, I didn’t find it interesting. In my [[opinion]], while [[adults|adult]] [[crack]] a joke, kids may take it [[seriously]]. [[Adults|adult]] should communicate with kids in an [[equal]] and [[frank]] manner. 


```bash
#当我还是个孩子的时候，我经常被告知我是从垃圾箱里被捡起来的。虽然我知道这是我父母开的玩笑，但我不觉得有趣。在我看来，当成年人开玩笑时，孩子们可能会认真对待。成年人应该以平等坦诚的方式与孩子交流。
