The date “520”, sounds similar to “wo ai ni” in Chinese, means “I love you”, has been more and more popular for the [[couple]]. 

```bash
# 在中文里日期520的发音里跟我爱你的发音相近 , 在恋人中越来越流行 . 
```
An increasing number of young couples to get married in this day rather than the traditional [[Valentine]]’s Day. 

```bash
# 跟传统的情人节相比, 在520这一天结婚的人数每年都在增加.
```
Most Young couples enjoy the romantic [[connotations]] behind the special date. 

```bash
# 很多年轻的恋人都非常享受特殊日期背后的浪漫内涵 .
```
According to the comments on the Internet, some people think it is romantic, and they’d like to share happy couples [[fortune]] in the holidays like 520.

```bash
# 根据网上评论, 一些人认为这样很浪漫 , 并且他们喜欢在这些特殊的日子晒出他们的幸福 .
```
However the increasing number of [[apparently]] meaningful days may lead to [[pressure]]s. 

```bash
# 但是越来越多的有意义的日子同时也会产生压力 .
```
Some men complain that it is too difficult to remember such a lot of [[ceremonies|ceremony]] per year. 

```bash
# 很多男人抱怨说每年记住这么多的日期太难了 .
```
To remember all of them and make preparation every time are [[burden]]s to them.

```bash
# 记住它们并且为每个日子做准备真的是个负担
```
In my opinion, I think marriage is a private thing between the couples. We don’t have to show it. Jumping on the [[bandwagon]] is not necessary.

```bash
# 我认为 , 结婚是两个人很私人的事情 . 没有必要晒给别人看 , 不需要随波逐流 .
```
