Dear Editor,

Recently, our classes have had a [[heated|heat]] discussion about whether the Beijing Zoo should be moved out of the city. 

```bash
#最近，我们班就北京动物园是否应该迁出城市进行了热烈的讨论。
```
As far as I am [[concerned|concern]], I’m in [[favor]] of the move. On the one hand, large [[crowds|crowd]] of [[tourists|tourist]] will result in [[traffic jams]]. Moving out of the downtown is also more convenient for people to get there via highway. On the other hand, once the zoo is moved, animals will have more space and better living [[conditions|condition]] in the [[suburbs|suburb]]. The space of the zoo can be [[broadened|broaden]] and more [[various]] animals can be [[bred|breed]] in it.

```bash
#就我而言，我赞成搬家。一方面，大量的游客会导致交通堵塞。从市中心搬出来，人们通过高速公路去那里也更方便。另一方面，一旦动物园搬迁，动物在郊区将有更多的空间和更好的生活条件。动物园的空间可以扩大，可以饲养更多的动物。
```
All in all, I think the zoo should be moved out of the [[downtown]].

```bash
#总而言之，我认为动物园应该搬出市区。
```
Yours [[truly]],

Li Ming
