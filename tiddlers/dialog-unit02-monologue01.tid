[00:01.93]The following monologue is about some causes of [[the generation gap]].
[00:07.31]One important cause of the generation gap is the [[opportunity]] that young people have to choose their own life styles. 
[00:15.76]In traditional societies, when children grow up, they are expected to live in the same area as their parents, 
[00:23.80]to marry people that their parents know and [[approve of]], and often to continue the family [[occupation]]. 
[00:31.11]In our society, however,young people often travel great distances for their education, 
[00:37.77]move out of the family home at an early age, 
[00:41.70]marry or live with people whom their parents have never met, 
[00:45.54]and choose [[occupation]]s different from those of their parents.
[00:50.18] In our [[upwardly]] mobile society, parents often expect their children to do better than they did: to find better jobs, 
[00:59.48]to make more money, and to do all the things that they were unable to do. 
[01:05.12]Often, however, the [[ambition]]s that parents have for their children are another cause of the division between them. 
[01:12.42]Often, they discover that they have very little in common with each other. 
[01:17.68]Finally, the speed at which changes take place in our society is another cause of the generation gap. 
[01:25.89]In a traditional culture, elderly people are [[valued]] for their [[wisdom]], but in our society the knowledge of a lifetime may become [[obsolete]] [[overnight]]. 
[01:38.27]The young and the old seem to live in two very different worlds, separated by different skills and abilities. 
[01:46.84]No [[doubt]], the generation gap will continue to be a feature of American life for some time to come.
