----------------------------------------

↓ whereas, nevertheless, but, however, still, while, yet 的辨析 ↓

----------------------------------------

这组词都有“但是，可是，然而，而”的意思，其区别是：

whereas >> 表对比，一般可与while互换。

nevertheless >> 指尽管作出完全让步，也不会发生任何影响。

but >> 口语常用词，语气较强，泛指与前述情况相反。

however >> 表转折关系，语气稍弱于but，连接性也弱一些，因而常作插入语。

still >> 语气强，多用于肯定句或疑问句。指尽管作出让步，采取措施或表示反对，但情况仍然如故，无所改变。

while >> 表对比，一般可与whereas换用，但程度弱一些。

yet >> 常用于否定句，语气比still稍强。指不管作出多大努力或让步，仍达不到预期的结果。
