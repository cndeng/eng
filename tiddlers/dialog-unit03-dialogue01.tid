[00:19.38]  Mr. Zhang visits his hometown, where he spent his childhood. 
[00:25.01]  Now he is talking with Mr. Jackson.
[00:29.00]  Zhang:We’re nearly there. 
[00:30.51]  All has come back to me. Look, the old park “People’s Park”is still there. 
[00:36.57]  I used to pass the park to go to school each day. 
[00:40.62]  Jackson:Really? I thought you are living in Xi’an city all your life. 
[00:45.70]  Zhang:No, I used to live in this old city from 1970s to early 1980s. 
[00:52.95]  Jackson:Have you ever been back since you left here?
[00:57.33]  Zhang:No, but I’m always dreaming of visiting it. 
[01:02.24]  I didn’t have enough time, so I’ve never come back. 
[01:07.21]  Jackson:Now, we are in the city center?
[01:11.30]  Zhang:Er, oh, yes, you’re right. 
[01:14.94]  The busy road, the [[skyscraper]]  s... 
[01:17.03]  It seems that the old [[department]]   store has disappeared. 
[01:21.32]  Jackson:It’s there! Right?
[01:23.61]  Zhang:Yeah, it has changed a lot, bigger and taller than ever, but there was no [[flyover]]   here in 1980s. 
[01:33.03]  Jackson:Look at these skyscrapers!
[01:36.94]  Zhang:Wonderful! But in the past, there were only small shops. 
[01:41.26]  I especially liked to buy sweets in one of them. Its name was “Xiao Hong Shop”.
[01:48.05]  Jackson:Twenty years have passed. Great changes have taken place.
[01:53.33]   We have been getting older, just as a saying goes“Time is waiting for no man”!
[01:59.97]  Zhang:I agree with you. 
[02:02.29]  My old guy, let’s find a parking lot and walk around the city, OK?
[02:08.46]  Jackson:OK, I’m glad to.

[00:20.75]Mr. Brown:Smog is blended with two words “smoke ”and “fog”.
[00:25.50]It has seriously affected people more than any other type of air pollution. 
[00:30.23]Robert:I see. Look, there are some [[plastic]] bags [[floating]] on the river. 
[00:35.27]Mr. Brown:Some citizens are still [[ignorant]] of the environmental protection. It’s really a [[pity]]!
