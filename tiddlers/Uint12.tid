A [[clinical]] [[supervisor]] of the [[psychology]] center [[conduct]]ed a [[survey]] of the [[depression]] in China. The research shows that more than 26 [[million]] people in China [[suffer]] from [[depression]].

```bash
#心理中心的一名临床督导对中国的抑郁症进行了调查。研究表明，中国有2600多万人患有抑郁症。
```
According to the researcher, the increasing number of the disease can be due to the competitive society and pressures from both working and living. And the most serious problem is that most patients refuse to recognize it or [[seek]] any [[aid]].

```bash
#根据研究人员的说法，越来越多的疾病可以归因于竞争激烈的社会和来自工作和生活的压力。最严重的问题是，大多数病人拒绝承认或寻求任何帮助。
```
In my opinion, the actual number of this disease may be higher because Chinese are [[conservative]] and don’t want to [[admit]] that they are depressed. Depression is hard to [[diagnose]] by ourselves. I think the [[prime]] solution is to make public [[campaign]] and improve people’s awareness of [[depression]].

```bash
#在我看来，这种疾病的实际数量可能更高，因为中国人比较保守，不愿承认自己患有抑郁症。抑郁症很难自己诊断。我认为最好的解决办法是进行公开宣传，提高人们对抑郁症的认识。
