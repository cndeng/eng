    A leader of the girl’s school announced that girls need to take part in sports activities. She believed that girls can build up their [[confidence]], [[endurance]] and [[adaption]] via sports. She [[emphasized|emphasize]] that only focusing on [[academic]] performance may [[deprive]] one’s ability to fight four [[setback]] and [[adversity]].

```bash
#这所女子学校的一位领导宣布，女生需要参加体育活动。她认为女孩可以通过运动来建立自信、耐力和适应能力。她强调，只注重学习成绩可能会使人丧失战胜四次挫折和逆境的能力。
```
An important way to change girls’ [[attitude]] [[toward]] sports is to [[broaden]] the girls’ sports [[varieties|variety]]. More [[diverse]] activities need to be provided, because not all girls are fond of the same sport.

```bash
#改变女孩对体育的态度的一个重要途径是拓宽女孩的体育种类。需要提供更多不同的活动，因为不是所有的女孩都喜欢相同的运动。
```
    Research shows that most successful women or female [[celebrities|celebrity]] like to [[excise]]. Most of them believe that taking part in sports activities helps for their career.

```bash
#研究表明，大多数成功女性或女明星都喜欢锻炼。大多数人认为参加体育活动有助于他们的事业。
```
I agree with that girls should take part in sports activities. Even for having a good [[figure]], doing exercise is healthier and useful than [[diet]]. For those who feel [[stressed|stress]] in [[competitive]] activities, they can choose less [[competitive]] ones, such as [[yoga]] and [[jogging|jog]]. 

```bash
#我同意女孩应该参加体育活动。即使有一个好的身材，做运动比节食更健康和有用。对于那些在竞争性活动中感到有压力的人，他们可以选择不那么激烈的活动，比如瑜伽和慢跑。
