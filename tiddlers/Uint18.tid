Can you [[imagine]] living with a long [[neck]] like the [[giraffe]]s? People might wonder how these long neck and tall animals eat, drink and sleep.
    It seems that giraffes need a big area to get enough room to lie down and sleep well. However, it is a misunderstanding. In fact, giraffes [[seldom]] sleep for long time, they can [[survive]] with half an hour sleep per day.
    The long height makes it difficult for them to sleep and drink, because it is hard to reach the ground. When being [[thirsty]], the spread their long legs and send down to let their head reach the water in the river. However, this [[awkward]] [[gesture]] will put them into a situation in which lacking of ability of defense from the [[beast]] of [[prey]]. Thanks to the long [[evolution]], giraffes can get their water from the [[leaves]] they eat. Therefore, they only need to drink every few days.
