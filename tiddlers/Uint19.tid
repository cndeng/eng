Dear Mike,
I am glad to hear that you are going to visit China this summer. There are many [[interesting]] and worth-visiting [[resort]]s and cities in China. But I recommend that Beijing, the capital city should be your first [[destination]].
    Beijing is an [[ancient]] city with a long history. The long history leaves Beijing [[precious]] cultural [[treasure]]. Back in 3000 years ago in Zhou [[dynasty]], Beijing, which was called Ji at the moment, had been named capital of Yan. [[Thereafter|thereafter]], Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing [[dynasty]] all made Beijing their capital. Therefore, Beijing was famous for “Capital of a thousand years.”
     Beijing is also a city with typical traditional cultural background, such as Peking Opera, Siheyuan and The Forbidden City, which was the Chinese [[imperial]] palace from the mid-Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. In 2008, it hold Summer Olympic games.
     Hope you enjoy your holiday in Beijing.
                                                        Yours [[sincerely]]
Lisa
