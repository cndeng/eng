There were very few places in the world that [[Jules Verne]], the writer, did not visit. 
He went [[round]] the world a hundred times or more.
Once he did it in eighty days, [[unheard]] of in the nineteenth century. 
He [[voyage]]d sixty thousand miles under the sea, [[toured|tour]] around the moon, explored the center of the earth, and chatted with natives in [[Australia]]. 
[[Jules Verne]], the man, was a stay-at-home. 
He was more likely to be tired from writing than from traveling. 
He did make a few visits to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]]. 
And he made one six week tour of New York State. 
But that was all. 
He spent less than one of his seventy seven years really traveling. 
Yet he was the world’s most [[extraordinary]] tourist. 
His books are crowded with hunting and fishing [[expedition]]s. 
Jules actually went hunting only once. 
Then he raised his gun and shot off the guard’s hat!
He never held a test [[tube]] in his hand. 
But he was an [[inspiration]] to the scientist in the [[laboratory]]. 
Long before radio was invented, he had TV working in his books. 
His name for it was [[phono]] [[telephoto]]. 
He had [[helicopters]] fifty years before the Wright brothers flew their first plane at [[Kitty Hawk]]. 
In fact, there were few wonders of the twentieth century that this man of the nineteenth century did not [[foresee]]（预见）. 
In his stories you can read about [[neon]] lights, [[moving sidewalks]]（人行道）, [[air conditioner]]s（空调）, [[skyscraper]]s, guided [[missile]]s, tanks, electrically operated [[submarine]]s（潜水艇）, and airplanes. 
Many people took his ideas [[seriously]]. 
One reason was that he wrote about these wonderful things in such [[exact]] details. 
Learned men would argue with him. 
Experts in [[mathematics]] would spend weeks checking his figures. 
When his book about going to the moon was published, five hundred persons volunteered for the next [[expedition]]. 
Perhaps the best known of all his books is Around the World in Eighty Days.
It first appeared as a serial in a [[Paris]] newspaper. 
Its [[hero]] had made a [[bet]] that he could circle the globe in eighty days, and his progress [[arouse]]d great interest. 
In every country of Europe people made bets on whether the imaginary Mr. Fogg would arrive in London in time to win his bet. 
[[Verne]] kept the popular interest alive. 
His hero rescued a [[widow]] from death and fell in love with her. 
He was attacked by Indians while crossing the American [[plain]]s. 
Arriving in New York, he saw the ship that was to take him to England disappearing over the horizon without him. 
All the big [[steamship]] companies offered Verne large sums of money if he would put Fogg on one of their ships. 
The author refused. 
Instead, he had Fogg charter a ship. 
As the world held its breath, Fogg reached London with only minutes to [[spare]]. 
Many of Verne’s other books were set in the future. In these stories, people made diamonds and developed a kind of automobile ship helicopter plane. 
They received news flashes on televisions, worked in [[giant]] [[skyscraper]]s, and rode to work on highways much like the ones we ride today. 
It is hard to believe that the books were written nearly one hundred years ago. 
Jules Verne had lived to see many of his [[fancies|fancy]] come true. 
But this had not surprised him, for he had once said: “What one man can imagine, another man can do.”
