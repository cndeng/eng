The day after [[Thanksgiving Day]]s, which is also called the [[Black Friday]], has became American shoppers’  “holiday”. It has became a [[tradition]] that every Friday after Thanksgiving is the shopping day, and [[dealer]]s put most of their goods on sale and all markets complete on price on this day. Shoppers are crazy for the goods with ever lowest price. But the low price may cause [[crowed]], pushing, and [[loot]]ing in the shops.

```bash
#感恩节的第二天，也被称为黑色星期五，已经成为美国购物者的“节日”。感恩节后的每个星期五都是购物日，这已经成为一种传统，商家在这一天出售大部分商品，所有的市场都在打折。购物者疯狂地购买价格最低的商品。但低廉的价格可能会造成拥挤，推搡和抢劫的商店。
```
However, there are some people who do not agree with this price-[[competitive]] [[phenomenon]]. They hold that people should not be [[encourage]]d in large [[consumption]]. The anti-capitalists are promoting people to [[take part in]] “Buy Nothing Day,”

```bash
#然而，有些人不同意这种价格竞争现象。他们认为不应该鼓励人们大量消费。反资本主义者鼓励人们参加“不买东西的日子”
```
In my [[opinion]], we should develop the [[awareness]] of [[appropriate]] [[consumption]]. What we really need is what we need to buy.

```bash
#在我看来，我们应该培养适当消费的意识。我们只买需要的商品。
```
