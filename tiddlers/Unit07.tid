Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my [[dissatisfaction]] about [[accommodation]]. I would prefer to move into a single room next [[semester]], as I find the [[present]] sharing [[arrangement]] is [[inconvenient]].

```bash
#我写信是为了表达我对住宿的不满。下学期我想搬到单间，因为我觉得现在的合租不太方便。
```

I must explain that the reason for my [[dissatisfaction]] is my roommate’s [[inconsiderate]] behavior. For one thing, his friends are [[constantly]] visiting him; for another, he regularly holds noisy parties.


```bash
#我必须解释我不满意的原因是我室友的不体谅人的行为。一方面，他的朋友经常来看他;另一方面，他经常举办喧闹的聚会。
```


To solve this problem, I hope to [[draw]] the attention of the [[authorities|authority]] concerned. I would be grateful if you could find a single room for me, [[preferably]] not in the same building but as near to the college campus as possible.

```bash
#为了解决这个问题，我希望引起有关当局的注意。如果您能帮我找一间单人房，我将不胜感激，最好不在同一栋楼里，但离大学校园越近越好。
```
Yours sincerely,

Sam
