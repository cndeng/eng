[00:04.70] Working Women
[00:06.77] Today more and more married women are working outside the home.
[00:13.16] For most of them, the reason is obvious: they must work if their families are to survive. 
[00:19.39] But what about those who don’t really have to work? 
[00:23.36] Do the rewards justify their efforts? 
[00:26.20] The answer is pretty clear “yes”. 
[00:29.55] The most obvious benefit of women working outside the home is financial. 
[00:34.86] The rising costs of living have forced many women to work simply to keep their families going. 
[00:41.03] And even in those families in which the wife has a choice, 
[00:45.53] the extra income may reduce the financial [[burden]] on her husband in paying for [[college]] for the children, 
[00:52.26] [[remodel]]ing their house, or taking a long delayed [[vacation]]. 
[00:56.39] For young couples the benefit is not being able to remodel a house, 
[01:00.87] it’s the possibility of buying one in the first place.
[01:04.52] If the wife does not work, buying a house is simply out of the question. 
[01:10.22] Two other points need to be considered, too.
[01:14.40] Even when the children have left the house, the drop in family costs is often replaced by the cost of supporting aging parents. 
[01:23.39] And second, a job provides a wife additional security, psychological as well as financial, 
[01:31.18] in case of the illness or death of her husband. 
[01:34.57] A second benefit, particularly for women in their late thirties or forties, is the [[relief]] from the [[boredom]] of housework. 
[01:43.26] They want a change from the deadly [[routine]] of washing clothes, making beds, cleaning the [[furniture]], and the like.
[01:50.97] Not all jobs are [[exciting]], of course;
[01:54.50] but they provide a change and a [[challenge]], particularly for those who feel their abilities and skills have been wasted at home.
[02:02.83] In addition, women who work often have more to [[contribute]] to conversations with their husbands and friends.
[02:09.81] And as their conversation becomes more lively, more interesting, they become more lively and interesting themselves. 
[02:17.57] But perhaps the most [[significant]] benefit of working is psychological. 
[02:22.96] Women have spent their early married lives looking after their homes, their children and husbands. 
[02:28.83] When their children are gone and the housework is reduced, 
[02:32.83] they often find themselves unable to [[cope with]] the extra time on their hands. 
[02:37.57] Working gives them something [[constructive]] to do outside the home. 
[02:41.71] Meeting new people on the job, putting long [[neglect]]ed skills to use, 
[02:47.11] competing successfully in the marketplace—all of these experiences help to build their self confidence; 
[02:54.06] they give a woman a sense of her own importance. 
[02:57.24] As she proves to herself that she can bring home the [[bacon]] as well as cook it ,
[03:03.86] she will open herself to new experience and [[broaden]] her interests. 
[03:07.74] But some people may ask, “Won’t all this make a wife less dependent on her husband?”
[03:14.47] Yes, quite likely. 
[03:17.63] Some husbands want their wives dependent upon them for all their needs. 
[03:22.19] But a truly happy, successful marriage means freedom for each partner to grow within the [[bond]]s of a loving relationship. 
[03:30.49] For some husbands the change will be painful, but all growth [[involve]]s pain. 
[03:36.18] And, in the long run, 
[03:37.98] it’s an acceptable price to pay for the personal growth and [[sense]] of [[achievement]] his wife will gain.
