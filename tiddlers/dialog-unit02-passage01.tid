[00:03.16]Enjoy the Round
[00:04.63]My old man was the [[original]] Silver Lining Guy. 
[00:08.77]As a [[teenager]] I called him Opti the Mystic because of his crazy [[optimism]] and his [[imperturbable]] ability to see any [[crisis]] as “an [[opportunity]] for growth”. 
[00:21.50]For 30 years my father had been a senior [[representative]] for one of the world’s largest [[firm]]s. 
[00:27.43]To Opti, hard work was a form of play because work involved solving problems. 
[00:33.17]This life view fit the [[philosophy]] of his favorite game—golf. 
[00:37.24]He first put a [[club]] in my hand when I was ten. 
[00:41.24]I was in such a rush to be good that he would [[urge]] me to “relax and enjoy the round. The game ends far too soon.” 
[00:49.57]I didn’t have a [[clue]] what he meant. 
[00:51.82][[Eventually]] when I grew up, golf became much more than a game between Dad and I.
[00:56.86]It acted as a means of seeing who this funny, [[oddball]] [[philosopher]] really was, and who I needed to become. 
[01:03.91]Dad was pushing 80. 
[01:05.49]But he always laughed off my concerns. 
[01:08.34]Now the cancer came back. 
[01:10.18]He had a month, two at most, he said, and [[merely]] asked me to save my strength for the golf course. 
[01:16.19]We played a course near the English village of Freckleton. 
[01:20.00]During World War II my father had served in an army on the outskirts of the village. 
[01:25.12]A local told us, “There was quite a [[memorial]] service because of the [[bomber]].”
[01:29.88]I glanced at Dad. “Do you know the bomber?”
[01:33.03]His [[complexion]] had turned [[pale]]. 
[01:35.67]“Yes. Come with me.”
[01:37.63]I followed him to a [[burying ground]] [[at the rear of]] a [[church]]. 
[01:41.47]“How did these [[folk]]s die?” I asked. 
[01:44.46]“They weren’t folks. 
[01:46.36]They were children. Four and five year olds.
[01:49.21] Thirty eight in all. 
[01:51.04]One of our bombers [[crashed]] into the school.” He shut his eyes. 
[01:54.89]“God, what a [[sight]]! 
[01:56.99]I remember pulling away pieces of the plane, bricks and all these precious kids inside...”
[02:02.88]I saw tears gathering in my father’s eyes, 
[02:05.53]“There was one girl who was always laughing. 
[02:08.18]I called her Lady Sunshine.
[02:10.18] A week after the crash, I found a note on the base of [[bulletin]] board from her parents. 
[02:15.37]They wondered if anybody had taken a photograph of her.
[02:18.52]I took them all the photos I had. We sat in their front [[parlor]] and cried. 
[02:23.21]I’ve never experienced anything so sad.”
[02:26.33]“I’m surprised you never told me this story, ” I said. 
[02:29.84]“The war ended for me right here, ” he said. “I promised myself I would never speak about it again.”
[02:37.47]The night before, he had told me that when he’d joined the Army he was a [[cocky]] guy. 
[02:42.85]Then “Something happened” and he [[realized]] “the only thing life really promises us is pain. 
[02:49.09]It’s up to us to create the joy”. 
[02:51.65]Opti the Mystic had been born in that bomber’s [[wreckage]]. 
[02:55.37]That night, my [[prayer]] was simple:  
[02:58.22]I hoped that my own children would never know the pain my Dad had known, 
[03:02.49]but if they must, I hoped the pain would make them little Optis. 
[03:06.59]Dad died the following [[March]]. 
[03:08.68]I was on the course near [[Freckleton]] again. 
[03:11.52]My partners, who had been warned what was coming, watched [[solemnly]]. 
[03:16.36]I told them my old man had said golf was a game that made you smile. 
[03:20.33]“So please smile.” 
[03:22.20]As they smiled, I scattered my father’s [[cremate]]d [[ash]]es into the [[bunker]]. 
[03:27.41]After the round, a boy passed me. 
[03:30.05]“Did you shoot a good one?” I asked. 
[03:32.58]“Not so good, sir.”
[03:34.29]“That’s okay, ” I said. “Enjoy it. The game ends too soon.”
[03:38.71]“Right. Thanks.”
[03:40.61]He walked on and I walked on—and then I stopped. 
[03:43.93]I’d heard it—my father’s voice.
